		<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p> I am a writer situated in Boston, Massachusetts. </p>
		    <p>
	Tumultous yet rewarding transitions in my life have paved my way to where I am now. 
			</p>
			<p>
	I have made my way from tiny yet, surprisingly modern, Arequipa, Peru to suburban Northern Virginia, where I have spent most of my childhood. My adolescence-era age was shaped by multitudes of things; family and friends who showed me what I was truly seeking for. As a curious person, I have found my wandering mind situated in the most unlikely places. Perhaps that is why I find books, especially, resonating. I found the journeys and plots others' lives so invigorating. So it may come to no surprise that I, myself, have made my journey to Boston, Massachusetts.
			</p>	 
		
			<p>
	I am currently attending a private college in Medford, Massachusetts. I find the city life more comforting now in my early 20's.  I find myself seeking new opportunities all around me. Iâ€™ve worked in industries ranging from data center operations to UX/UI design to writing. All areas that have given me a better insight on my aspiring careerpath.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
	If you ever want to get in contact with me, feel free to message me. My inbox is always open.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
	All my best,
			<br>
	Cristina
