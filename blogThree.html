		<h3> The Preface </h3>
			
		<p> 			
		It was almost like any other cold, misty night. Except, it wasn’t.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nothing about this night was like any other. 
		</p>
		<p>
		While the same crescent fold of the moon bestowed upon me, the location was different. I was cast in the city that never sleeps, cast among masses of different people.
		</p>
		<p>
		Instead of the suburban lighting that I’d typically receive, I was showered with illuminating billboards and signs. I was dumbfounded by the street shows occurring, by the environment itself. As I walked along every corner, I became more and more convinced that this was a land of its own.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, back then I was 12, and oh so proud to label myself as a pre-teen; it is easy to see why New York City amazed me. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But the amazement, the enthrallment, was short-lived; as any ordinary person could imagine reality isn’t all rainbows and giggles. No, unfortunately, we do not live in a society that only nurtures playful atmospheres; no, we live in a society that is jaded.
		</p>
		<p>
		Adults passed left and right of me, a quickly saddening little girl. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When I visited New York City, I wasn’t just mesmerized by the city itself, no, I was stricken by the individuals at Times Square. The realization that people inhabited the streets of the supposedly gold-paved streets of America shocked me. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Where was the American Dream? A land, I only previously thought was a safe haven. I had made my way here with hopes of a better for myself and my family, but I quickly caught on to the reality around me. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The world is cruel. People are unfair. And, well insurance issues and political polarization are all too common problems that many of us face, citizens or not. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It was only till later that I discovered the mechanism behind the “American Savior”.
		</p>
		<p>
		Oh silly me, how could I have not seen the red flags?
		</p>
