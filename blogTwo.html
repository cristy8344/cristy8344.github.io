		<h3> A Typical Jumbos' Wednesday</h3>
			
		<p> 
			
		I’ve noticed that for us as storytellers, there is a tendency to unravel a story and then, just then, make those bits and pieces come together. However, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez has shown me, there is no shame in writing circularly or even adding my own sense of flair. That is why today I will tell you about a mundane Wednesday.
		</p>
		<p>
		The pleasantly lukewarm morning allows me to wake up refreshed. I get ready and then, I	walk towards Lane Hall, where my Web Programming (CS20) class will begin.</p>
		<p>
		The lecture ends, and I go down the hill, waiting for the warm breakfast sandwich that awaits me at my loyal friend on campus: Hodgdon. Peers fly by, each one making the last few minutes, before the class count. It is the trek uphill after all. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I stroll down. They walk up.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once I finally arrive at Hodgon, otherwise known as Hodg, I can not help but smile inwardly at the sight before me: emptiness. No waiting this time. I guess, I just got lucky. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We are now deep in the semester when projects, finals, and assignments are all being finalized. Everyones’ optimizing time, energy, and space to work.
		</p>
		<p>
		My next stop is Mayer Campus Center (CC), where I get to plop myself down in the comfort of the sofa chairs. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Time to work.
		</p>
		<p>
		So, I do just that.
		</p>
		<p>
		This time, time is on my side.
		</p>
		<p>
		I review the research I have done for my engineering psychology class and confirm team meetings for later that week. It is just past 1 pm, and I am ready to take a quick sip of Boba from Hotung Café.
		</p>
		<p>
		So I wait in line, grab my beverage, and swiftly bring myself near the corridor. Content with a drink in hand, I wait for the shuttle. 
		</p>
		<p>
		While I wait, I see the flying Autumn leaves surrounding me; whether they are on the ground or flying whimsically around me, I take in the rustic color.
		</p>
		<p>
		The only thought that weighs on my mind is:
		</p>
		<p>
		Today really is a good day to be a great day.
		</p>
